# 🎬💡 OmniRecommend

A hackathon proof‑of‑concept that lets people **discover movies, series, anime, and video‑games they’ll love** – powered by OpenAI for preference parsing and live content APIs (TMDB & RAWG).

> “Type *I like clever shark thrillers with no super‑powered heroes*, hit **Recommend**, and get instant cross‑media picks.”

---

## ✨ Features
- **Free‑form taste prompt** – Users can describe what they feel like watching/playing in natural language.
- **Likes / Dislikes rating loop** – Every thumbs‑up/down refines future suggestions in real‑time.
- **Cross‑media search** – Movies/TV from TMDB, games from RAWG, (stretch: anime from AniList).
- **Why this?** – Each card shows keywords that matched the user’s prompt so recommendations feel transparent.
- **Zero database required** – Works entirely from live APIs and in‑memory caching; persistence is optional.
